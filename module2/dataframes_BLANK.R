# Factors are variables that have levels / categories / groups

class(data$habitat) # If R < 4.0, this will be a factor. If R >= 4.0, this will be a character.

# Step One: Do we want to treat this variable as a factor or a character?

# Step Two: Do we need to change it?

# Step Three: If so...

## Change a character column to a factor


## Change a factor column to a character


# WARNING: What happens if you tried to switch from a factor to a number?
test_sites <- as.factor(c(34, 34, 35, 35, 36, 36)) # Create a new object to test this out on
test_sites # This is what it looks like
class(test_sites) # It is a factor
levels(test_sites) # It has three levels
as.numeric(test_sites) # Why do you think this happens?

# If you use R >= 4.0 you are less likely to run into trouble with factors!

# ---- Joining Data ----
# How might we want to combine these data sets?
head(data)
head(taxonomy)

# Demonstration Using Test Data
test_survey1 <- data.frame(person = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
                           colour = c("red", "blue", "green", "blue"))

# Functions in the _join(x, y) family add columns from y to x, matching rows based on the key(s)

# left_join(x, y)   : keeps all rows that appear in x


# inner_join(x, y)   : keeps all rows that appear in BOTH x and y


# full_join(x, y)   : keeps all rows that apear in EITHER x or y



## Which join do we want to use to combine our two data frames?
head(data)
head(taxonomy)



# Make this change permanent


# ---- Converting Cases ----
# Is there anything we might want to do to clean up the scientific names?


# Convert to lower case


# Convert to title case


# Convert to sentence case


# Make the change permanent by overwriting the existing column
