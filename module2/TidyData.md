## Tidy Data  

*"Tidy datasets are all alike, but messy datasets are each messy in their own way." ~ Hadley Wickham"*  

Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is  
messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations,  
variables and types. In tidy data:  
1. Each variable forms a column.  
2. Each observation forms a row.  
3. Each cell contains exactly one piece of information.  

The four most common problems with messy datasets:  
1. Column headers are values, not variable names.
2. Multiple variables are stored in one column.
3. Variables are stored in both rows and columns.
4. Multiple pieces of information are stored in single cells.
