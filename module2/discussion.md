How have you used spreadsheets in their research?  
Have you ever accidentally done something in a spreadsheet that made you frustrated or sad?  
What do you typically use spreadsheet for?  
What do you think you should not use spreadsheets for?  

### Reproducibility  
How do you keep track of your analysis?  
How do you organize your data and data files?  

### Messy Data  
How does the data stored in `messy.xlsx` follow or break the rules of tidy data?  
What would you do better organize this data?  

### Reflection  
Are there any aspects of your own data entry or data formatting that should be changed to meet tidy data requirements?
